ofxToxiclibs
============

This is going to be a c++/of port of Karsten Schmidt's (toxi) ToxicLibs. 

My plan is to develop this port for the next weeks/months, but never put 100% of my time and concentration on it. I hope I will make it to the end without being too distracted by other things. You're invited to port a couple of classes - some help is highly appreciated!

Libraries
=========

In order to run the tests yourself, you need to have CppUnit 1.12.1 installed:
[CppUnit](http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/cppunit/index.php?title=Main_Page)
